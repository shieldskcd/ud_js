# JavaScript - The Complete Guide 2022 (Beginner + Advanced)
This repository will house the code from the Academind course

## Module 1
1. Uploaded the "Getting Started" files from the author's resources.
2. Changed the code in the index.html file to call the inter-modal files for the in-page links.
3. Installed the Material Icon Theme Extension for VS Code as suggested by the author.
4. Installed the Prettier extension for VS Code as suggested by the author. 
5. Created a course FAQ for review. 

## Module 2
1. Downloaded the "Unconventional Calculator" code from the course.
2. Created the Git FAQ document
3. Created a new app.js file to store new javascript code for our page. 
4. Created an inline script to do the same thing that the app.js file does but loads on page load. 
5. Replaced the inline script with a call to our newly created app.js file. 
6. Began creating a keyword library for JavaScript for later review.
7. Created a variable called 'currentResult' and initialized it to 10.
8. Used multiple operators to change the output. 
9. Create a new variable that stores the actual calucluation being performed on the data in the webpage. 
10. Created a variable that uses concatenation to illustrate values in the calculation string.
11. Created a constant variable to setup our default variable.
12. Used the backtick (`) to force the use of a *template literal* in curly braces { }.
13. Downloaded the "Practice Variables, Constants, Operators, & Core Data Types" to begin the assignment.
14. Created a small javascript file that takes a number and performs various operations on it. Ultimately we use alerts to present the data that was delivered with that program.
