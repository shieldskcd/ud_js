# Common Keywords used in JavaScript

## Alert
Alert simply creates a pop-up box that will display a message to the user when it is executed. A simple example is `Alert("This is an alert")` which will create a pop up on the page saying "This is an alert".

## Let
Let creates a new variable when it does not exist such as `let userName = "Max"` to created a variable called `UserName` and set its value to `Max`. If you later type `userName = "Joe"` then it will **overwrite** the variable previously used. 

## Const
Const creates a variable which **cannot change**. If you create something like `const TotalUsers = 15;` and then later try to set `totalUsers = 20;` you will get an error because this is not supposed to change.
